Covenant Health Site Conversion Files
=====================================

These files represent the working directories and distribution files for the conversion of all [Covenant Health](http://www.covenanthealth.com/) websites to [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org/) using the [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com/) framework.

##Notes

Any brand-specific files (such as logo files) contained within this directory are copyrighted by Covenant Health, and their use is not permitted. Any code carries over the license of the originator of that code (e.g., Wordpress code uses the GPL, and Bootstrap uses the MIT license), and certain limitations may apply that aren't covered here. Anyone that wishes to fork this repo should take that into account.

Other code contained in Javascript and CSS files may also have separate licensing requirements.
